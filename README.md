# MQTT Client for iOS

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol. It works on top of the TCP/IP protocol.

This client by default will CONNECT to the test broker at http://broker.hivemq.com and PUBLISH a message to the topic, which you will create. 

To run the example project, clone the repository and install the necessary pod ('CocoaMQTT')
